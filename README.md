## Projects

### Digital Forensics Investigation | Class Project | Autopsy

Conducted a digital forensics investigation as part of my coursework, focusing on unauthorized access and potential intellectual property theft within an organization.

- **Initial Setup** (Hypothetical): In the project scenario, the investigation team would collaborate with the legal department to define the investigation scope, obtain necessary permissions, and establish a baseline of expected access for the suspect. This step was part of the theoretical planning phase of the investigation.
- **Evidence Collection**: The hands-on portion of the investigation began with the use of **Autopsy** to create a case and ingest a disk image (JSmith_Q1.001). Forensic tools such as FTK Imager were described for bit-by-bit disk imaging, and Volatility was used for volatile memory analysis.
- **Analysis & Reporting**: Utilized **Autopsy** to analyze disk images and identify sensitive data, including confidential and proprietary documents. Investigated signs of potential steganography and found evidence pointing to a plan to sell proprietary information via **Bitcoin**.
- **Conclusion**: Wrote a report detailing the findings, showing unauthorized access and data theft, as well as the potential use of **Bitcoin** for illicit transactions.

This project enhanced my understanding of forensic methodologies, evidence collection, and analysis using tools like **Autopsy**, while considering the legal aspects of digital forensics.

### TryHackMe: Bricks Heist | Vulnerability Exploitation & Incident Investigation
Completed the **Bricks Heist** room on TryHackMe, where I identified and exploited a vulnerability in a WordPress site (CVE-2024-25600) to gain access to the victim system. My tasks included:

- **Recon & Initial Investigation**: Used WPScan to identify the WordPress version, discovering a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-25600).
- **Exploitation**: Ran a Python exploit, gaining initial access with Apache privileges and confirming system vulnerabilities.
- **System Exploration**: Tracked hard-coded credentials and a suspicious process, discovering a Bitcoin miner running on the system.
- **Investigation & Analysis**: Analyzed the Bitcoin miner logs, traced the wallet address to LockBit ransomware, and documented the findings.

This hands-on exercise helped reinforce my skills in exploitation, forensic investigation, and threat analysis.

### Secure Expense Tracker | Web Application Security Testing | Tools: Postman, OWASP ZAP, ESLint, Aikido Security
Collaborated with my husband to security test a full-stack expense tracker application. Conducted thorough vulnerability assessments of the application and its API, focusing on input validation, injection risks, and proper error handling. 

Key tasks included:
- **API & Web Application Testing**: Identified and mitigated injection risks and sensitive data exposure.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Tested for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in user input.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Used OWASP ZAP and ESLint for security flaw detection and remediation.
- **Code & Dependency Analysis**: Ran Aikido Security for dependency scanning and implemented necessary fixes.
- **Security Recommendations**: Advised on the addition of authentication and emphasized caution with sensitive information until full security features are integrated.
