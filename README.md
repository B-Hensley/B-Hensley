## Projects

### TryHackMe: Pickle Rick | Web Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
Completed the **Pickle Rick** room on TryHackMe, a CTF focused on web exploitation and privilege escalation. My tasks included:

- **Recon & Enumeration**: Used nmap and manual browsing to identify open ports and access a web server with hidden directories and credentials.
- **Initial Access**: Logged into a web portal using discovered credentials and exploited command injection via a search form to gain shell access.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Explored the file system, retrieved multiple hidden messages, and used Linux enumeration techniques to escalate privileges.
- **Flag Capture**: Successfully located and read all required flags, including the final root message from Rick.

This CTF strengthened my foundational skills in Linux privilege escalation, web enumeration, and command injection.

### TryHackMe: Bricks Heist | Vulnerability Exploitation & Incident Investigation
Completed the **Bricks Heist** room on TryHackMe, where I identified and exploited a vulnerability in a WordPress site (CVE-2024-25600) to gain access to the victim system. My tasks included:

- **Recon & Initial Investigation**: Used WPScan to identify the WordPress version, discovering a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-25600).
- **Exploitation**: Ran a Python exploit, gaining initial access with Apache privileges and confirming system vulnerabilities.
- **System Exploration**: Tracked hard-coded credentials and a suspicious process, discovering a Bitcoin miner running on the system.
- **Investigation & Analysis**: Analyzed the Bitcoin miner logs, traced the wallet address to LockBit ransomware, and documented the findings.

This hands-on exercise helped reinforce my skills in exploitation, forensic investigation, and threat analysis.

### Secure Expense Tracker | Web Application Security Testing | Tools: Postman, OWASP ZAP, ESLint, Aikido Security
Collaborated with my husband to security test a full-stack expense tracker application. Conducted thorough vulnerability assessments of the application and its API, focusing on input validation, injection risks, and proper error handling. 

Key tasks included:
- **API & Web Application Testing**: Identified and mitigated injection risks and sensitive data exposure.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Tested for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in user input.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Used OWASP ZAP and ESLint for security flaw detection and remediation.
- **Code & Dependency Analysis**: Ran Aikido Security for dependency scanning and implemented necessary fixes.
- **Security Recommendations**: Advised on the addition of authentication and emphasized caution with sensitive information until full security features are integrated.
