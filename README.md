## Projects

### Digital Forensics Investigation | Class Project | Autopsy
Conducted a comprehensive digital forensics investigation as part of my coursework. The project involved analyzing a suspected unauthorized access case within an organization, following best forensic practices.

- **Initial Setup**: Collaborated with the legal department to define the scope, obtain necessary permissions, and establish the baseline of expected access.
- **Evidence Collection**: Used tools like FTK Imager for bit-by-bit copying of workstations, Volatility for volatile memory capture, and Wireshark for network traffic analysis.
- **Analysis & Reporting**: Investigated system logs, network traffic, and workstation data to determine the nature of the breach. Utilized Autopsy for in-depth examination of disk images, identifying potential security violations.
- **Conclusion**: Provided a detailed report on findings, including the use of evidence like company policies, AUPs, and NDAs to determine unauthorized access and potential intellectual property theft.

This project enhanced my understanding of digital forensics methodologies, including evidence handling, legal considerations, and data analysis using forensic tools.

### TryHackMe: Bricks Heist | Vulnerability Exploitation & Incident Investigation
Completed the **Bricks Heist** room on TryHackMe, where I identified and exploited a vulnerability in a WordPress site (CVE-2024-25600) to gain access to the victim system. My tasks included:

- **Recon & Initial Investigation**: Used WPScan to identify the WordPress version, discovering a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-25600).
- **Exploitation**: Ran a Python exploit, gaining initial access with Apache privileges and confirming system vulnerabilities.
- **System Exploration**: Tracked hard-coded credentials and a suspicious process, discovering a Bitcoin miner running on the system.
- **Investigation & Analysis**: Analyzed the Bitcoin miner logs, traced the wallet address to LockBit ransomware, and documented the findings.

This hands-on exercise helped reinforce my skills in exploitation, forensic investigation, and threat analysis.

### Secure Expense Tracker | Web Application Security Testing | Tools: Postman, OWASP ZAP, ESLint, Aikido Security
Collaborated with my husband to security test a full-stack expense tracker application. Conducted thorough vulnerability assessments of the application and its API, focusing on input validation, injection risks, and proper error handling. 

Key tasks included:
- **API & Web Application Testing**: Identified and mitigated injection risks and sensitive data exposure.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Tested for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in user input.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Used OWASP ZAP and ESLint for security flaw detection and remediation.
- **Code & Dependency Analysis**: Ran Aikido Security for dependency scanning and implemented necessary fixes.
- **Security Recommendations**: Advised on the addition of authentication and emphasized caution with sensitive information until full security features are integrated.
